## Agogô Bell – a BBC media monitoring tool

A tool to help search BBC television programmes for occurrences of a word
or phrase, providing links to recent iPlayer programmes at the timestamp
where the word or phrase occurred.

### How does it work?

Using Phil Lewis’ excellent
[get_iplayer](http://linuxcexntre.net/getiplayer), we download and index
iPlayer subtitles. We store approximate timestamps so we can link through
to the original content.

### Why the name?

It’s a [samba instrument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agog%C3%B4), and an
anagram of “googlable”! It probably won’t stick, but it’ll do for now :)
