## Agogo Bell – a BBC media monitoring tool

A tool to help search BBC television programmes for occurrences of a word
or phrase, providing links to recent iPlayer programmes at the timestamp
where the word or phrase occurred.

### How does it work?

Using Phil Lewis’ excellent
[get_iplayer](http://linuxcexntre.net/getiplayer), we download and index
iPlayer subtitles. We store approximate timestamps so we can link through
to the original content.

TODO: On its way!
