## Agogo Bell – a searchable iPlayer subtitle database

Search BBC iPlayer programmes for occurrences of a word or phrase, and
provide a link to (or embed) the iPlayer programme at the timestamp where
the word or phrase occurred.

### How does it work?

Using Phil Lewis’ excellent
[get_iplayer](http://linuxcexntre.net/getiplayer), we can download and
index iPlayer subtitles. We store approximate timestamps so we can link
through to the original content (the BBC no longer permits embedding.)
